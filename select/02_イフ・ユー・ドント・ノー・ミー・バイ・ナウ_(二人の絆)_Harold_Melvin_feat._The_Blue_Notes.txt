Sing the song, everybody
C'mon

If you don't know me by now (wunderbar)
You will never, never, never know me
Oooh

Now all the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you

Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To upset our happy home

Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
You know we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me, baby
(You will never never never know me)
No, you won't (oooh)
Oooh, yeah, c'mon

Oh, if you don't know me, girl
(You will never never never know me)
You... (Uuuh)

We've all got
Our own funny moods
I've got mine
I bet you woman you've got yours too

You better trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do

Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me, baby
(You will never never never know me)
No, you won't (Oooh)
No, you won't, no, you won't, no, you won't

Twenty long years we've been together
(You will never never never know me)
(Ooohh) ooh ooh-ooh oh

Well...
Oooh (You will never never never know me)
No, you won't (oooh)
